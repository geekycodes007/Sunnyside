# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page

## Welcome! 👋

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
This focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!
The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and animation states for all interactive elements on the page
